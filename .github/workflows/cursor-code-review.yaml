          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          
          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
          3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end
          
          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines
          
          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement
          
          Submission:
          - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary
          - Use only: gh pr review --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes"
